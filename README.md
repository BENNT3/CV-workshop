# CV-workshop

## Instructions

After we have looked at some general formatting pointers and discussed the purpose and functions of a CV in class, you should have the tools you need to fix a broken CV.

You can find the PowerPoint comparing formatting options (with notes) in this repo, as well as Joe Bloggs's CV which needs your help.

1. Fork this whole repo and clone your fork to your computer.
2. Open Joe's CV and have a good, critical look.
3. Within your forked repo on GitHub, use the issues tracker to note a list of things that need to be changed.
4. Make the changes in a new .md document on your computer.
5. Push to GitHub.
6. Start a pull request to have your new CV for Joe reviewed by a classmate or two.
7. Look at pull requests from other people and leave constructive comments.

We should be able to collaboratively come up with a new CV for Joe. Which ever version we decide to use will have the pull request accepted and merged.
